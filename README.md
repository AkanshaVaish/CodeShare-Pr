# CodeShare-Pr

The UX programmers face some problem while working with HTML/CSS/JS and other UX designing frameworks. These problems include things like coding the whole thing in a single file which makes it hard to maintain and build on. Along with this, it is hard to go to html page in the google chrome and see the output for the change they made. So this project is a tool where you are provided different windows to write your UX code and you can write all your different code in different windows and see the output right away.

# Getting Started

You just need to clone the repository into your local machine and then run the HTML file on a browser. Chrome is the more supported browser as of now. You can use this tool on your localhost and write code there and see the output right away. 

# Contribute

There is a scope of improvement in this project. Anyone is free to give suggestions or some work in order to make the user's code combined into one file which can be downloaded by the user and he doesn't need to copy and paster the whole text into the local machine editor. The UX can be improved along with the backend. It can be converted into a user applicatoin where they can make their accounts and keep their stuff online and they can access it whenever they would like to.
